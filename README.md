This demonstrates an implementation based on react-css-transitions that exhibits a different animation based on whether the browser action is push or pop. 

Some drawbacks are that the browser's forward button acts like a pop rather than a push. As far as I have been able to find out - there is no reliable way to determine whether the action is 'forward' or 'back'.
